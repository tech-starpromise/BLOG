Hey, I'm Xing Xu（XingXu, _@tech-starpromise_）, a graduate student from an ordinary university who knows a little about computers but loves technology. I like to research difficult things. My English is OK and my Russian is OK, but I'm very good at Chinese (ಡωಡ). I call myself ~~a compound talent~~ born from the hybrid of [SDJTU](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2/1241424) and [DSTU](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%A1%BF%E6%B2%B3%E5%9B%BD%E7%AB%8B%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/6988279).

The current physical activities are mainly in Russia and China, and my virtual avatars appear on [Weibo](https://weibo.com/u/3265066500), [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/279381516), [X](https://x.com/Starpromise.jia), [Github](https://github.com/tech-starpromise), etc.
